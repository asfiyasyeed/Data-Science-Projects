# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the classic **Titanic Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle/Seaborn's internal datasets.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Gender:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate (over 70%) compared to males (under 20%).
- **Passenger Class:** First-class passengers had a much higher chance of survival than those in third class.
- **Family Size:** Passengers traveling in small families (2-4 members) had a better survival rate than those traveling alone or in very large families.
-  **Dataset:** The classic **Titanic dataset** was loaded directly from the Seaborn library in Python. No external file was needed.


# Project 2: Student Performance Prediction (Regression)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project was to build an end-to-end machine learning model to predict a student's final grade (G3) based on their academic and demographic data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the **Student Performance Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, sourced via Kaggle.
* **Dataset:** The **[Student Performance Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen096/student-performance-data-set)** was sourced from Kaggle.

## ðŸš€ Model Performance
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Approximately **0.86**. This means the model can explain about 86% of the variability in the students' final grades.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Approximately **1.16**. On average, the model's predictions were off by about one grade point.

# Project 3: Comparing Classification Algorithms

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal was to build and compare two different classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict the presence of heart disease.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, sourced from Kaggle.
The **[Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-uci)** was sourced from Kaggle.

## ðŸš€ Model Comparison
- **Best Performing Model:** **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (~85%). This is likely due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
- **Fastest & Most Interpretable Model:** **Logistic Regression** was much faster to train and is more interpretable, as its coefficients directly explain the influence of each feature on the prediction.

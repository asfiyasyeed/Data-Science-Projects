Project 3: Comparing Classification Algorithms
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal was to build and compare two different classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict the presence of heart disease.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the Heart Disease UCI dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The Heart Disease UCI dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

ðŸš€ Model Comparison
Best Performing Model: Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~85%). This is likely due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
Fastest & Most Interpretable Model: Logistic Regression was much faster to train and is more interpretable, as its coefficients directly explain the influence of each feature on the prediction.

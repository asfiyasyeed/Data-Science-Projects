Project 2: Student Performance Prediction (Regression)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project was to build an end-to-end machine learning model to predict a student's final grade (G3) based on their academic and demographic data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, sourced via Kaggle.

Dataset: The Student Performance Data Set was sourced from Kaggle.
ðŸš€ Model Performance
Model Used: Linear Regression
R-squared (RÂ²): Approximately 0.86. This means the model can explain about 86% of the variability in the students' final grades.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Approximately 1.16. On average, the model's predictions were off by about one grade point.

Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the classic Titanic Dataset, sourced from Kaggle/Seaborn's internal datasets.

ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate (over 70%) compared to males (under 20%).
Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a much higher chance of survival than those in third class.
Family Size: Passengers traveling in small families (2-4 members) had a better survival rate than those traveling alone or in very large families.
Dataset: The classic Titanic dataset was loaded directly from the Seaborn library in Python. No external file was needed.
